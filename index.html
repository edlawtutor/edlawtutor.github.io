<p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Ed and I am a math tutor. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University and I previously worked in the automotive industry as a senior engineering specialist for 28 years. In my spare time, I worked with elementary through high school students coaching FIRST Robotics in my kids’ school district for 8 years. After taking an early retirement and moving to the Bay Area, I decided to continue doing what I love: working with students.</p>

<p>I tutored my two kids since they were in elementary school. I worked with them on math all the way through high school. As a result, they were able to fully understand the mathematical concepts and excelled in the classroom. They both earned a 4.0 GPA and top percentile standardized test scores. After receiving offers from many top schools, both of them chose to attend Stanford University.</p>

<p>In addition to math tutoring, I also work with students and parents on all the challenges associated with applying to colleges, including ACT/SAT Test Prep. Having recently gone through the same process with both of my kids, I know how much stress there is regarding college admissions. I found that just a little guidance can go a long way for students and their parents.</p>

<p>Because I am retired and not planning to be a full time tutor, my availability is extremely flexible. No matter what it is, from last minute quiz reviews to long test-preparation sessions, feel free to shoot me a message and I will find the availability to accommodate you. If interested, I recommend a free “get-to-know-you” session with both student and parents to assess the student’s exact needs, set goals and expectations, and create a plan to ensure success. I look forward to hearing from you!</p>

            	<p>The most effective way to teach math to young kids is through a hybrid of the mastery approach used in many Asian countries and the mindset approach used in many Western countries. I used this hybrid approach with both of my own kids who studied math 3 years ahead of their class. I also like to make math fun by using games to reinforce the mathematical concepts rather than using an approach like Kumon. I am using this approach with my elementary math students with great success. Mastering the basic arithmetic and concepts is very important for later math subjects.</p>

As we encounter topics the student is not familiar with, I will stop and explain the topics thoroughly. It is very important that students have a firm command of fractions arithmetic before starting pre-algebra.</p>

            	<p>Calculus is a very abstract topic that students often find intimidating. Many of my students have told me that the way I explained the concepts was easier to understand than the way they learned it in school. I am able to break down complicated calculus concepts into easy-to-understand lessons. This helps to demystify a scary subject and allows students to be more confident in the classroom.</p>

            	<p>The standard approach of tutoring SAT Math seems to be reviewing math topics and working on as many problems as possible from an SAT practice book. This type of preparation is time consuming and has limited success. My proven method is very different. I believe students benefit more from an individualized approach targeting their weaknesses. After a last-minute two-hour lesson, one student took the SAT a second time and improved their SAT math score from 590 to 650. Another two of my students improved their scores from the mid-600s to mid-700s after just 10 lessons.</p>

            	<p>The standard approach of tutoring ACT Math seems to be reviewing math topics and working on as many problems as possible from an ACT practice book. This type of preparation is time consuming and has limited success. My proven method is very different. It is similar to the methodology used in training for sports or other activities: learning good techniques and putting in a lot of practice. In math, learning good techniques means learning the most efficient way to solve each type of problem. Once you master the techniques, then it is practice, practice, practice. Students should take as many previously-administered ACT tests as they can.</p>
                <p>I have coached both of my kids to get a 36 on their ACT Math using this approach. It can work for you too. One student improved their ACT math score from 24 to 30 after 7 one-hour lessons, and another student improved their score from 25 to 32.</p>
