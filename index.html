<p></p>
<p>Hello, my name is Ed and I am a math tutor. I received my Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University and I previously worked in the automotive industry as a senior engineering specialist for 28 years. In my spare time, I worked with elementary through high school students coaching FIRST Robotics in my kids’ school district for 8 years. After taking an early retirement and moving to the bay area, I decided to continue doing what I love: working with students.</p>

<p>I tutored my two kids since they were in elementary school. I worked with them on math all the way through high school. As a result, they were able to fully understand these concepts and excelled in the classroom. They both earned a 4.0 GPA and top percentile standardized test scores. After receiving offers from many top schools, both of them chose to attend Stanford University.</p>

<p>In addition to math tutoring, I also work with students and parents on all the challenges associated with applying to colleges including ACT/SAT Test Prep. Recently having gone through the same process with both of my kids, I know how much stress there is regarding college admissions. I found that just a little guidance can go a long way for a student and their parents.</p>

<p>Because I am retired and not planning to be a full time tutor, my availability is extremely flexible. No matter what it is, from last minute quiz reviews to long test-preparation sessions, feel free to shoot me a message and I will find the availability to accommodate you. If interested, I recommend a free “get-to-know-you” session with the parents and the students to assess the student’s exact needs, set goals and expectations, and create a plan to ensure success. Looking forward to hearing from you!</p>

            	<p>The most effective way to teach math to young kids is through a hybrid of the mastery approach used in many Asian countries and the mindset approach used in many western countries. This hybrid approach can produce the most results in the shortest time. I used it with both of my own kids who studied math 3 years ahead of their class. I also like to make math fun by using games to do the repetition rather than using approach like Kumon. I am using this approach with my elementary math students with great success. Mastering the basic arithmetic and concepts is very important for later math subjects.

With my system, I use this time to stretch their mind, teach them to see patterns, solve problems by thinking outside the box and make math fun. As we encounter topics they have not learned, we will cover the topics thoroughly. Of course, it is very important that students have a firm command of fractions arithmetic before starting pre-algebra.

Many of my students told me that they like how I explained the concepts which are easier to understand comparing to how they learned it in school.

            	<p>Many of my students told me that they like how I explained the Calculus concepts which are easier to understand comparing to how they learned it in school. I was able to breakdown complicated calculus concepts into easy to understand lessons. It helps to de-mystify a scary subject and allow the students to be more confident going into taking a test.

            	<p>Whether it is in a small class setting or private tutoring, the standard approach of tutoring SAT Math seems to be reviewing math materials and work on as many problems as possible from an SAT practice book. From my experience, this type of preparation is time consuming and with limited success. My proven method is very different. After a last minute two hour lesson, one student took SAT a second time and the SAT Math improved from 590 to 650. After just 10 lessons, another two of my students improved from mid 600s to mid 700s. I am currently working with a few other SAT Math students.
